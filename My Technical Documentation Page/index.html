          <p>Search Engine Optimisation is the process of making your website better for search engines. Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is used to make it easier for search engines like Google to crawl, index and understand your content. The ultimate goal is kaing your web page more discoverable through the use of organic search results, as opposed to paid promotion.</p>
          <p>Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) contain both paid and unpaid results to search queries. SEO does have it’s limitations as some search features, that aren’t paid for, cannot be influenced by optimisation. They are usually linked to proprietary sources such Wikipedia, IMDb or WebMD.</p>
          <p>SEO appears more trust-worthy to searchers when compared to paid advertising as well as receiving more clicks from users. Another benefit to using organic means is that SEO pays dividends over time, with the right keywords traffic will continue to be driven to your site over time whereas paid methods will require further payment to continue bearing fruit. </p>
          <p>White Hat vs Black Hat; referring to best practices, namely White Hat, which look to maximise the value provided to users whereas Black Hat looks to fool search engines into ranking your content higher.</p>
          <p>Understanding user intent is key in SEO. People usually have a desired outcome which falls into one of three categories:
            <ul>
              <li>Transactional: Trying to buy something</li>
              <li>Navigational: Looking for a particular webpage</li>
              <li>Informational: Who sings ‘x’ song? SERP replies with one definitive answer</li>
              <li>Commercial Investigation: Comparison of products</li>
              <li>Local Queries: ‘X’ near me</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Common KPI’s for SEO include:
            <ul>
              <li>Sales</li>
              <li>Email subscriptions</li>
              <li>Downloads</li>
            </ul>

        <header><h2>Crawling, Indexing and Ranking</h2></header>
        <article>
          <p>Search engine crawlers will scour the internet looking for content be that webpages, images, pdfs etc. By obtaining a few web pages and following the links contained on those pages, the crawlers are able to find new material which can be retrieved for searchers at a later date. These URLs are indexed in huge databases in order to be called upon when a search is conducted. When this happens the search engine will find the most relevant content in the index and rank said material by its relevance to the user’s query.</p>
          <p>Discover if Google has indexed your pages by using an advanced Google search operator. If no results are found it could be for any of the following reasons:
            <ul>
              <li>No external websites linking to your page</li>
              <li>Site hasn’t been crawled yet as it is brand new</li>
              <li>The navigation on your page is difficult for robots to crawl</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Robots.txt</h3>
          <p>Robots are used to inform search engine crawlers which pages they should and should not crawl. Don’t place the location of sensitive information in publicly accessible robot.txt files. NoIndex them instead and put them behind a login form.</p>
          <p>Common Navigation Errors:
            <ul>
              <li>Using JavaScript for your website’s navigation, most bots are better suited to working with HTML</li>
              <li>Having different navigation for mobile users versus desktop one’s</li>
              <li>Personalised navigation, showing one visitor a page that is inaccessible to another</li>
            </ul>
          </p>The robots meta tag is usually used within the <head> of the HTML page and denotes what actions a crawler should or should not perform on said page.
            <ul>
              <li>index/noindex: NoIndex is our way of telling crawlers that this page should be excluded from their search results.</li>
              <li>follow/nofollow: NoFollow instructs crawlers not to follow links on a page.</li>
              <li>Noarchive: Stops search engines from saving a cached copy of a page. E.g. if prices regularly change on a website you might not want a search to show pages containing copies of old prices.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>NB: With the X-Robot tag you can get more specific, excluding entire files and folders from search engines.</p>
          <h3>Ranking</h3>
          <p>Links are used to help rank the utility of content through algorithms such as PageRank. They examine the quality of backlinks to your page to judge the authority your page holds. The more organic backlinks you have from trusted pages the more likely it is that your page will rank well in search results.</p>
          <p>Engagement metrics will include:
            <ul>
              <li>Bounce Rate (# of sessions where people only visited 1 page on the site)</li>
              <li>Pogo Sticking (# of times people clicked the link and went straight back to the SERP)</li>
              <li>Clicks</li>
              <li>Time Spent On Page</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        <article>
          <p>Keywords with very high search volumes are often sought after however they may not be great indicators of user intent. Long tail keywords often convert better into customers as they tend to be more specific and intentional. Look at the SERP to understand user intent for certain keywords.</p>
          <p>There are a number of tools to help determine the value that a keyword may provide to your page:
            <ol>
              <li>Google Keyword Planner</li>
              <li>Google Trends</li>
              <li>AnswerThePublic</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <h3>Content Quality Control</h3>
          <p>Google prefers in-depth content on one page rather than multiple pages with weak low quality content for every keyword. The Panda update of 2011 directly addressed this issue.</p>

        <article>
          <p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are all important elements that SEO’s should know about.</p>
          <p><b>HTML</b> will determine the structure of your page. This is what the crawlers will read when indexing your webpage.
            <br> <b>CSS</b> is responsible for the appearance. It allows your page to be less code heavy as the style of the page is kept in a separate file. In turn this allows the page to load faster which adds to the UX of your website. CSS is used to make your website more mobile friendly and ensure that when the page is indexed (mobile indexed first) it still ranks well.
            <br> <b>JavaScript</b> makes your website interactive. However JS works with client-side rendering rather than server-side as a lot of the JS is executed in the client’s browser. This means that some elements that are critical won’t be visible in your code until the client’s browser is loaded. This extra layer of indexing can mean that Googlebot misses some of your key elements when crawling your page.</p>
            <p>One of the ways around the above problem is to use Google Search Console’s ‘URL Inspection’ tool, by pasting your URL into the Google search bar and testing the live URL. This allows you to see your page the way Googlebot sees it and compare it to how a client may see your content.</p>
            <p>Canonicalisation and Schema Markup are ways to ensure search engines understand your content. When you have duplicate pages and the crawler is unsure which page to index you can use canonicalisation to denote where the original piece is located. Schema Markup is used to organise your content and tell the search engine exactly what certain parts are.</p>

          <p>Images are one of the main offenders when it comes to slowing down your page and it’s loading speeds. Here are a few ways to counteract this:
            <ul>
              <li>Use the SRCSET attribute where you can have multiple forms of the same image and then specify which one you want to use in varying scenarios.</li>
              <li>Use lazy loading to show a blurry low resolution form of the picture until the page has loaded.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Other methods include bundling and minification to reduce file size and increase the speed of your webpage.</p>
